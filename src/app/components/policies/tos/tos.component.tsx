                    Story Squad is intended for children in 3rd through 6th grade, as well as their
                    parents or legal guardians. Anyone who is not part of one of these audiences may
                    not use Story Squad. Any account identified as belonging to or being controlled
                    by someone who is not part of our target audience will be immediately deleted,

                <div>
                    <h2>Account Access and Security</h2>

                    <p>
                        Every Story Squad account consists of at least two users: the designated
                        Parental User - who must be a legal adult in accordance with the laws of
                        their jurisdiction - and a child or children of whom the Parental User has
                        legal guardianship. It is the responsibility of you, the Parental User, to
                        maintain the confidentiality of your password and other account information
                        that you provide by not sharing this information with others. You are
                        expected to take reasonable measures to maintain your own confidentiality
                        and to promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your Story Squad
                        account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By creating an account, you agree that any information you provide is
                        accurate and up-to-date. You also agree not to impersonate or misrepresent
                        your identity or affiliation with anyone else's identity. We reserve the
                        right to verify the accuracy of information you provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Story Squad does not allow search-indexing or public access to the profiles
                        or creative content of its users.

                    <h2>Subscription Fees</h2>

                    <p>Story Squad is a paid subscription service.</p>

                    <p>
                        By activating a subscription, you agree that we may automatically renew your
                        subscription under the same subscription terms on the next business day
                        after your previous subscription ends, unless you cancel your subscription
                        before that point. When a subscription renewal would normally fall on a day
                        that does not occur in the current month (for example, a subscription that
                        would normally occur on the 31st, in a month like February which has only 28
                        days) your subscription will renew on the last day of the current month.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We retain the right to change our fee structure at any time at our sole
                        discretion, and these changes will apply to you and your account at the end
                        of your current subscription period. We will notify you by email of any
                        changes to the subscription price before renewing at said price. You may
                        cancel your subscription at any time by visiting the subscription section of
                        your dashboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may offer promotional trial subscriptions, fee waivers, or special
                        pricing at our discretion. These special subscriptions are subject to their
                        own payment terms.

                    <p>
                        As part of the process of registering a child user, you must either use a
                        credit card or other payment mechanism accepted by us to create your
                        subscription, which provides us with verified parental consent for your
                        child's use of the service.

                    <p>

                        through a third-party payment processor. By accepting these terms, you
                        acknowledge that, in the event the third-party processor experiences a data
                        breach through no fault of Story Squad, Story Squad is in no way liable or
                        responsible to you for the breach or any consequences thereof.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are responsible for charges (including any applicable taxes) relating to
                        any subscription, service, or merchandise that you order through Story
                        Squad. If we do not receive payment from the payment mechanism you use, you
                        agree to pay any amounts due upon our demand. You are solely responsible for
                        any disputes with your financial institution or payment provider, and for
                        any charges which your provider levies against you.
